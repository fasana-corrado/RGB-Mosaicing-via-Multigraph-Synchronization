# IACV-Project
RGB image mosaicing via multi-graph synchronization.

## Instructions:
1) Install the requirements via the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
2) Run Main.ipynb to reproduce a single experiment. It is possible to choose the dataset and other parameters as specified in the comments.
3) Run ExperimentalResults.ipynb to run multiple experiments using the same dataset and settings.
4) Run Benchmark.ipynb to visualize statistics about the conducted experiments.

## Intermediate results
Intermediate results can be visualized and saved setting "verbose = True", "save_output = True" and "save_images = True".

## Dataset acquisition
If a new dataset is to be acquired, it is necessary to ensure that images are taken rotating the camera around its center.
