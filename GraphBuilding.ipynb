    "This notebook contains the code that implements the graph building procedure.\n",
    "Starting from the dictionary of matches found in the Feature Matching phase, it is possible to build a graph whose nodes are the images and edges are the pairwise homographies. This graph is useful both for visualization and for optimization.\n",
    "Here we also compute the matrices needed for the various stitching methods (Z, C, M) and we perform graph expansion to deal with multi-edges graphs."
